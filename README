Cookieless Web Counter

"Cookieless Web Counter" (CWC) is a very simple web site visit counter which allows a very fast and easy monitoring of the number of visitors to many web sites at once without setting cookies and therefore protecting users privacy. The script collects only the informations that the user's browser sends to the web site server (IP address, referrer and browser details). CWC is suited for a quick daily glance at many web sites traffic. The code is written in PHP and MySQL; the user interface involves plain HTML without Javascript.


Main Features

- No cookies are set
- Monitor many web sites at once from a single page
- Shows only the number of visitors and unique visits of today and yesterday
- For each site show last 50/100/200 visits
- Each visit includes timestamp, page name, remote IP address, referer label and user agent
- Multi language (translators needed!!)
- Visits from bots/spiders are shown in gray in the dump page


Installation instructions

1) create a table in the MySQL database importing the table_structure.sql file
2) for each monitored site add configuration parameters (db name, user, password) to config.inc.php and to a copy of tracker.inc.php
3) add the configured tracker.inc.php at the end of each page of the monitored site
4) upload the config.inc.php and cwc.php on one of the monitored web sites and load cwc.php


Future directions

* Improve graphic interface

* Add more functionalities

* Translate into other languages

* Adding support for databases other than MySQL (MariaDB...)

* ... suggest other implementations!
